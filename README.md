# funwheel-controller

This repository contains code to add some additional features to the Funwheel by enhancing it with a separate ESP32-controller to control front- and back-lights, monitor the battery and add Bluetooth VESC-UART-bridge

The ESP32 D1 Mini is highly recommended, but other ESP32 also work.
